<!--Node js someone took the part that knows how to run javascript in chrome and built an ecosystem around it so you can run it outside of the browser
//Node.js website - download - nothing has changed except when you got to your termanial and run 'node' you will see a carrot > an interactive mode that you can type javascript expressions and it will run them inside of terminal (just like the console but by default there is no DOM elements)
//what node is good for is to run programs from your command line - node can read files from your computer (such as writing a program to rewrite the titles of all music files)
//It can also run a webserver

//today we are looking at socket.io
it a platform for doing applications what connect alot o people in web browsers during real time
line 29 down the connection message is the meat of the program 
Event listeners: 'set nickname' 
sendMessage 'send message'
looks up persons name using socket.id then sends this message to the client through 

socket.broadcast.emit('new message', {
	contetns: msg,
	name: name
});
