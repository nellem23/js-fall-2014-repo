#### Introduction

In recent years, Javascript has gone from being treated as a toy to a serious platform, powering our most pervasive interactions. We'll look at how this language breathes life into the web, and can be used to create powerful applications and compelling artwork.

#### Outcomes

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Skillfully use the web as a platform for creative and artistic explorations
- Think creatively in a technical context, and vice versa
- Build richly interactive web experiences
- Employ the latest HTML5 features in their projects
- Demonstrate familiarity with modern front-end development practices


#### Projects and Evaluation


During the first half of the class, there will be weekly exercises. Then students will complete larger midterm and final projects. These projects are the core of this course: students are expected to think out of the box, experiment with the technology, and iteratively polish their work. 

This will be an interactive class. Students are expected to be engaged and ready to participate. Hands-on-the-keyboard practice is the only way to learn to program.

#### Books & Resources

I’ll be assigning required readings from the web to supplement the class work. We’ll be using [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) for many of the readings. It’s free online, but also available in print if you like to have a physical book.

For those seeking more:

If you feel like you have less programming experience than the rest of the class, the tutorials on [codeacademy.com](http://codeacademy.com) might be helpful for you. We’re going to move fast, so this is a great resource for some extra help.

In addition, I strongly recommend that you check out the following websites, or at least know their existence, as they can prove immensely useful when you need them. More topic-specific resources will be shared in class.

- Book introducing HTML5: [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/)
- Technical reference: [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (this is a lot better than W3C’s documentation)
- Technical Q&A: [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (you will very likely find that your question has already been answered)
- Creating shareable javascript experiments: [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net)
- Advanced HTML5 articles: [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/)

#### Grading Standards

__A__ - Superior work. You have clearly demonstrated an enthusiasm for the projects, and an understanding of the concepts that guide your decisions. Your work demonstrates original and creative thinking in the field of creative web development. Your projects are consistently and cleanly executed with a high level of attention devoted to craft and details. You’re able to explain your own work and offer insightful critique of your classmates’ projects. You are present in class and participate in discussions.

__B__ - Good work. You’ve completed all of the projects with a sufficient level of quality. Your projects are less conceptually clear, but you have displayed clear effort in attempting an understanding. Your projects are cleanly executed with a good level of attention devoted to craft and details. You’re able to explain your own work and offer insightful critique of your classmates’ projects. You are present in class and participate in discussions.

__C__ - Satisfactory work. You’ve shown that you can interact with the concepts presented in class, but you have not demonstrated a deep understanding or enthusiasm for your work. You do not demonstrate a high level of attention to craft. You participate in some discussions but have not added insightful critique.

__D__ - Your work adheres to each project’s guidelines but you have not demonstrated original thought or depth of understanding of the concepts presented in class. You have not participated in class discussions, or have missed a significant amount of classes. 

__F__ - Failing grades are given for required work that is not submitted or for incomplete final projects. Make-up work or completion of missed assignments may be permitted only with the approval of the instructor and the program director. 

__I__ - A grade of I (Incomplete), signifying a temporary deferment of a regular grade, may be assigned when coursework has been delayed at the end of the semester for unavoidable and legitimate reasons. Incomplete grades are given only with the written approval of the instructor and the program director. The Request for an Incomplete Grade form must be filled out by the student and instructor prior to the end of the semester.

For undergraduate students, if a grade of incomplete is approved, outstanding work must be submitted by the seventh week of the following Fall semester (for Spring and Summer courses) or by the seventh week of the following Spring semester (for Fall courses). Otherwise, a grade of I will automatically convert to a permanent unofficial withdrawal (WF) after a period of four weeks. For graduate students, the maximum deadline for completion of an incomplete is one year though a shorter period may be imposed at the discretion of the instructor.

#### Divisional, Program and Class Policies

__Responsibility__ – Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.  Late or incomplete projects and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.  

__Participation__ – Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.  

__Attendance__ – Faculty members may fail any student who is absent for a significant portion of class time. A significant portion of class time is defined as two absences for classes that meet once per week. Lateness or early departure from class may also translate into one full absence. Please contact me prior to class if you know you will have to miss all or a portion of our session.

__Delays__– In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class due to my full-time job.  If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, students are expected to wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival.  In the event that I will miss class entirely, an email notification will be sent in advance. I do not expect this to happen.

__Guidelines for Studio Assignments__ – Work from other visual sources may be imitated or incorporated into studio work if the fact of imitation or incorporation and the identity of the original source are properly acknowledged. There must be no intent to deceive; the work must make clear that it emulates or comments on the source as a source. Referencing a style or concept in otherwise original work does not constitute plagiarism. The originality of studio work that presents itself as “in the manner of” or as playing with “variations on” a particular source should be evaluated by the individual faculty member in the context of a critique.

__Student Disability Services__ – In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately.  All conversations will be kept confidential.  Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me.  At that point I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.  Mr. Luchs’ office is located in 79 Fifth Avenue, 5th floor. His direct line is (212) 229-5626 x3135.  You may also access more information through the University’s web site at http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/.

__Using Code You Didn't Write__ - All programmers use code they didn't write. I encourage you to seek out libraries to help you meet your needs. Please document all code snippets, libraries, blog posts you used in the production of your work. Code should be used, extended and changed, not just incorporated without change.
